## Introduction

The Python News API project is a simple Python script that uses the News API to fetch and display top news headlines from around the world. Stay informed about global events without leaving your terminal!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- You have obtained an API key from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/global-news-headlines.git
   cd global-news-headlines
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```sh
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Replace `"YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY"` with your actual News API key in the `news.py` script.

## Usage

Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python news_app.py
```

Follow the prompts to input a country code (e.g., `us`, `gb`, `in`) and view the latest news headlines from that country.
